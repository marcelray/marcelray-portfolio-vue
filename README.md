# Marcel Ray Professional Portfolio
Vue.js-based portfolio site, updated in 2021.

## Overview

Hand-written personal portfolio. Uses all run-time based libraries (Vue.js, LESS) for portability and ease in development/management. For larger-scale projects I would have more fun with transpiling.

## Tasks List

[ ] Add case studies with documented process
[ ] Add 'About me' profile page
