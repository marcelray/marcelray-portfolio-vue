# Marcel Ray Professional Portfolio
Vue.js-based portfolio site, updated in 2021.

## Overview

Hand-written personal portfolio. Uses all run-time based libraries (Vue.js, LESS) for portability and ease in development/management. I would have more fun with build tools and transpiling for larger-scale projects or those with performance considerations.

## Tasks List

- [ ] Add case studies with documented process
- [ ] Add 'About me' profile page
- [ ] Create 'Labs' section for experiments and personal projects
- [ ] Pie in the sky: Create a 3D WebXR version?
