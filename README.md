# Marcel Ray Portfolio

Hand-written professional portfolio, completely rebuilt and redesigned in 2021. 

Uses ES6 and all run-time based libraries (Vue.js, LESS) for portability and ease in development/management. I have fun with build tools and transpiling on larger-scale projects or those with performance and compatability considerations.

- [ ] Add 'About me' profile page
